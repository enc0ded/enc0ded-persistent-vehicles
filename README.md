# enc0ded-persistent-vehicles

[[THIS VERSION IS DEPRECIATED AND NO LONGER SUPPORTED; PLEASE USE VERSION 2.0]]

The new version can be found here https://fivem-mods.tebex.io/package/4499436

This mod prevents vehicles from disappearing in OneSync multiplayer servers. It can also respawn vehicles in their previous location after a server restart.

## Requirements
>FiveM Version >=2443
>OneSync - This mod will not work without OneSync.
 
## Installation
Download or clone from repo. Place the enc0ded-persistent-vehicles folder in your resources folder. Open config.lua and configure to your needs. Start the resource.
```bash
start enc0ded-persistent-vehicles
```

## Usage
To make a vehicle persistent, pass its entity to the event below in a client script. For example if you are using ESX you can put this in the call back of the ESX.Game.SpawnVehicle function.
```lua
  # client event
  TriggerEvent('persistent-vehicles/register-vehicle', entity)

```
To update a persistent vehicle, pass its entity to the event below in a client script. For example if you are using ESX you can put this in the call back of the ESX.Game.SetVehicleProperties function.
```lua
  # client event
 TriggerEvent('persistent-vehicles/update-vehicle', entity)

```
Stop a vehicle from being persistent and allow it to be removed as normal. Does not delete the vehicle.
Call this when a player puts away a vehicle. Also remember to call this on your admin delete vehicle commands.
```lua
  # client event
  TriggerEvent('persistent-vehicles/forget-vehicle', entity)
```
If you enable repopulate on reboot then you need to call the server event below before your server shuts down. This will ensure that the vehicles spawn in the exact same location when the server comes back online. 
```lua
# server event
TriggerEvent('persistent-vehicles/save-vehicles-to-file')
```
Alternatively you can stop the resource which will do this automatically.
```lua
# server event
StopResource('enc0ded-persistent-vehicles')
```

## Server Console Commands
Cull persistent vehicles
```bash
pv-cull <number of vehicles>
```
Unpersist vehicles
```bash
pv-forget-all
```
